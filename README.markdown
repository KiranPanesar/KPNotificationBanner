KPNotificationBanner is a small ribbon banner for displaying notifications that I created to use in an application a while back. To get an idea for its looks, check out the attached sample project. The sample project also clearly shows how the two banner types can be created and shown.

A sound is played when the banner is shown/hidden. This requires the inclusion of AudioToolbox.framework into the project. The only other dependency is QuartzCore.framework.

Let me know if you have any questions either by email (KiranSinghPanesar@googlemail.com) or by tweeting me (@K_Panesar).

Thanks!
